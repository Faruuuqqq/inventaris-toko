                    SESSION SUMMARY - PHASE 3 COMPLETE
================================================================================

Date: February 3, 2026
Duration: 5 hours
Work: Completed Phase 3 - Controller Method Verification

================================================================================
                              WHAT WAS DONE
================================================================================

✅ PHASE 1: Endpoint Extraction (2 hours)
   - Extracted 95+ endpoints from all view files
   - Organized by type: AJAX, Form, Navigation, Special
   - Created PHASE1_ENDPOINT_EXTRACTION_REPORT.md

✅ PHASE 2: Route Verification (1 hour)
   - Verified 42 critical endpoints in Routes.php
   - Found all routes defined with correct HTTP methods
   - Found 1 naming issue (saldo endpoint)
   - Created PHASE2_ROUTE_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md

✅ PHASE 3: Controller Verification (2 hours)
   - Verified 42 controller methods across 16 files
   - Found all required methods exist (100%)
   - Fixed 2 critical issues:
     1. Added Suppliers::getList() method
     2. Fixed Saldo endpoint naming (/stockData → /stock-data)
   - Resolved false alarm (Sales::store intentional design)
   - Committed all changes
   - Created comprehensive reports:
     - PHASE3_CONTROLLER_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md
     - PHASE3_SUMMARY.md

📊 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION CREATED
   - PHASE4_TESTING_GUIDE.md (preparation for next phase)
   - PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md (overall progress tracking)

================================================================================
                            ISSUES FIXED
================================================================================

ISSUE #1: Suppliers::getList() Method Missing
   Severity: CRITICAL
   Impact: Supplier dropdown broken in all forms
   Solution: Added method to app/Controllers/Master/Suppliers.php
   Status: FIXED & COMMITTED

ISSUE #2: Saldo Endpoint Naming Mismatch
   Severity: MEDIUM
   Impact: Saldo stock data would return 404
   Solution: Fixed view endpoint from /stockData to /stock-data
   File: app/Views/info/saldo/stock.php (line 211)
   Status: FIXED & COMMITTED

ISSUE #3: Sales::store() Method Not Found
   Finding: Confirmed intentional design
   Reasoning: Sales uses type-specific methods (storeCash, storeCredit)
   Status: NOT AN ISSUE - RESOLVED AS DESIGN DECISION
